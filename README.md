# Intro to Machine Learning wihh Tensorflow - Udacity Nanodegree

This repository conatains the projects I worked on during Udacity's Nanodegree "Intriduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow".

The Nanodgree consisted of three parts:
__1. Supervised Learning:__


In this repository you find my code for the following three Projects:
__1. Find Donors for CharityML:__
In this project I used supervised machine learning models to identify residents which are most likely to donate to a charity. I trained different models to find out which algorithm works the best on the given data, tuned the most promising ones and finally evaluated the results.

# Intro to Machine Learning with Tensorflow - Udacity Nanodegree

This repository conatains the projects I worked on during Udacity's Nanodegree "Intriduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow".

<br>
<br>
The Nanodgree consisted of three parts:
<br>
<br>
__1. Supervised Learning__
<br>
__2. Deep Learning__
<br>
__3. Unsupervised Learning__
<br>
<br>
In this repository you find my code for the following three Projects:
<br>
<br>
__1. Find Donors for CharityML:__
<br>
In this project I used supervised machine learning models to identify residents which are most likely to donate to a charity. I trained different models to find out which algorithm works the best on the given data, tuned the most promising ones and finally evaluated the results.
<br>
__2. Build an Image Classifier__:
<br>
In this projct I implemented an image classification application using a deep neural network with with TensorFlow. This application will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It will then use the trained model to classify new images. First I will developped the code in a Jupyter notebook to ensure my implementation works well. Then I creatd a application which can easily be called from the command line. 
<br>
__3.Create Customer Segments__:
<br>
In this project I applied unsupervised learning techniques to cluster costumer data to identify different customer segments. I cleaned the data and applied PCA transformtion to reduce the number of features. On the cleaned data I applied a clustering algorothm and evalauated the results.
